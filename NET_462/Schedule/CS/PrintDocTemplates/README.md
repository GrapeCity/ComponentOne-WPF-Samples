#### Demonstrates creating C1.C1Preview.C1PrintDocument templates for printing C1Scheduler's views.
____
The sample is based on using C1.C1Preview.C1PrintDocument component and System.Windows.Controls.DocumentViewer.
The sample creates C1PrintDocument templates for different C1Scheduler views and saves them into working folder. 
Later the saved templates can be used for printing and previewing.

You can use the sample code as it is or edit it in any convenient way.
Please use C1.WPF.PrintDocument for printing support instead of retired C1.WPF.C1Report assembly.
