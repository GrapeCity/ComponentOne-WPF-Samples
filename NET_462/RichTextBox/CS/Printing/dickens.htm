            of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each
            other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no

            <h4>
                MARLEY'S GHOST.</h4>
        </center>
        <p>
            <span class="caps">Marley</span> was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever
            about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
            undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was
            good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was
            as dead as a door-nail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is
            particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard
            a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of
            our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or
            the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically,
            that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and
            he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor,
            his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend,
            and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event,
            but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and
            solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from.
            There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing
            wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced
            that Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more
            remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
            than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after
            dark in a breezy spot-say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance-literally
            to astonish his son's weak mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards,
            above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and
            Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes
            Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching,
            grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from
            which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and
            solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
            nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips
            blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head,
            and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always
            about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one
            degree at Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
            External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no
            wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow
            was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather
            didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and
            sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often "came
            down" handsomely, and Scrooge never did.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, "My dear
            Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?" No beggars implored him
            to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman
            ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.
            Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming
            on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their
            tails as though they said, "No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark
            master!"
        </p>
        <p>
            But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along
            the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was
            what the knowing ones call "nuts" to Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once upon a time-of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve-old
            Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy
            withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down,
            beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement
            stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite
            dark already-it had not been light all day-and candles were flaring
            in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable
            brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
            without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were
            mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything,
            one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon
            his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.
            Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller
            that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept
            the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel,
            the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the
            clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
            effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" cried a cheerful voice. It
            was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
            was the first intimation he had of his approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!"
        </p>
        <p>
            He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of
            Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his
            eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Christmas a humbug, uncle!" said Scrooge's nephew. "You
            don't mean that, I am sure?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I do," said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What right have you to
            be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Come, then," returned the nephew gaily. "What right have you
            to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough."
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, "Bah!"
            again; and followed it up with "Humbug."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't be cross, uncle!" said the nephew.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I live in such
            a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
            Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding
            yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and
            having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against
            you? If I could work my will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot
            who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled
            with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Uncle!" pleaded the nephew.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nephew!" returned the uncle sternly, "keep Christmas in your
            own way, and let me keep it in mine."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew. "But you don't
            keep it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge. "Much good may it
            do you! Much good it has ever done you!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have
            not profited, I dare say," returned the nephew. "Christmas among the
            rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round-apart
            from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to
            it can be apart from that-as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
            time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women
            seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
            below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another
            race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never
            put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it <i>has</i> done me
            good, and <i>will</i> do me good; and I say, God bless it!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of
            the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i>," said Scrooge, "and
            you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a
            powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to his nephew. "I wonder you
            don't go into Parliament."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow."
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge said that he would see him-yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length
            of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew. "Why?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Because I fell in love."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Because you fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
            one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. "Good afternoon!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it
            as a reason for not coming now?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had
            any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to
            Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas,
            uncle!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And A Happy New Year!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the
            outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was,
            was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge; who overheard him:
            "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about
            a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."
        </p>
        <p>
            This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in.
            They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
            in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to
            him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen,
            referring to his list. "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or
            Mr. Marley?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied. "He
            died seven years ago, this very night."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,"
            said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
            It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word "liberality,"
            Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.
        </p>
        <p>
            "At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the gentleman,
            taking up a pen, "it is more than usually desirable that we should make some
            slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.
            Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want
            of common comforts, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And the Union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge. "Are they still
            in operation?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "They are. Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish I could say
            they were not."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?" said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Both very busy, sir."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred
            to stop them in their useful course," said Scrooge. "I'm very
            glad to hear it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or
            body to the multitude," returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring
            to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose
            this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance
            rejoices. What shall I put you down for?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nothing!" Scrooge replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You wish to be anonymous?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge. "Since you ask me what
            I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas
            and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments
            I have mentioned-they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Many can't go there; and many would rather die."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do
            it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides-excuse me-I don't
            know that."
