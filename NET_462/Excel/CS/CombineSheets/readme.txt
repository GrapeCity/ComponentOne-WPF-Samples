CombineSheets
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combines sheets from several Excel workbooks into a single workbook.

The sample scans all the xls files in a folder, clones the first sheet,
renames it with the file name, and adds the cloned sheets to a master
workbook. It then saves the combined workbook into a file and opens that.
