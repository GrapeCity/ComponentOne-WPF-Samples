GridTooltips
---------------------------------------------------
Shows how to use hit testing to add cell-specific tooltips.

The application uses the standard WPF TooltipService to
create a tooltip attached to the grid.

It uses a custom CellFactory to attach tooltips to cells when
they are created.
