HierarchicalDataTemplate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates advanced binding scenarios using the DataTemplateSelector and
HierarchicalDataTemplate classes.

The DataTemplateSelector class allows you to select different templates based on features 
of specific data items. For example, you could use different templates to display directors, 
managers, and clerical staff.

The HierarchicalDataTemplate class allows you to bind the C1OrgChart control to items that 
contain items of different types. For example, you could create a chart that displays 
leagues, divisions within each league, and teams within each division.
