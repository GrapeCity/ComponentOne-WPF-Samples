#### Live views with XML.
____
This sample demonstrates basic live view functionality for views
based on XML (LiveLinq to XML).

Run the application and try, for example, the following:


* Change the ShipCity value from "London" to "Colchester" or
vice versa in any of the two grids and leave the current row
(to commit the change). Observe that the value in the other
grid changes correspondingly.


* Change the ShipCity value to any string other than "London"
and "Colchester" in any of the two grids. Observe that the row
disappears from both grids.
