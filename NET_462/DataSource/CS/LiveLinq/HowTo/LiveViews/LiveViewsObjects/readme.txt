LiveViewsObjects
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Live views with object collections.

This sample demonstrates basic live view functionality for views
based on user-defined object collections (LiveLinq to Objects).

Run the application and try, for example, the following:

* Change the ShipCity value from "London" to "Colchester" or vice
versa in any of the two grids and leave the current row (to commit
the change). Observe that the value in the other grid changes
correspondingly.

* Change the ShipCity value to any string other than "London" and
"Colchester" in any of the two grids. Observe that the row
disappears from both grids.
