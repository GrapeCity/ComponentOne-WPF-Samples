CustomColumn
-----------------
Demonstrates an example of the CustomFieldColumn class usage.

This sample adds the special custom column (Actual Cost) that
is calculated as a full cost of the resource multiplied by
the amount of the resource usage. The value in the "Actual
Cost" column is recalculated each time when any of its source
values (such as resource cost or task duration) is changed.
