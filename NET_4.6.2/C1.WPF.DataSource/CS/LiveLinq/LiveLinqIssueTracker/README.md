#### Live views sample application.
____
This demo shows how live views can be used to construct entire
GUI applications based almost entirely on declarative queries/views and
data binding, with little procedural code. It also contains an example of
how live views can be used in non-GUI, batch, perhaps server-side processing.

It is a mockup bug/issue tracking application in a fictitious company
that produces Shakespeare's plays. The demo comes in three variations,
each built on top of a different data store: Collections
(uses LiveLinq to Objects), ADO.NET (uses LiveLinq to DataSet)
and XML (uses LiveLinq to XML). It uses WinForms data binding,
but WPF data binding could be used instead just as well
and the live views would be exactly the same.

For details, see "Live views sample application (LiveLinqIssueTracker)"
in the "Samples" part of the LiveLinq documentation.
