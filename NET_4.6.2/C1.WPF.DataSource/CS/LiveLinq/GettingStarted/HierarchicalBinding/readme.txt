HierarchicalBinding
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data binding of a grid and other controls to live views, in WinForms and WPF.

These samples show how to use LiveLinq live views in non-trivial data binding
scenarios including master-detail data binding and currency management.

These samples use an ADO.NET data source, but the principles are the same for
all other in-memory data sources, including plain CLR objects and XML data.

It starts with a simple application using traditional data binding
(folder: Traditional). Then it shows how you can easily convert that
application to take advantage of LiveLinq (folder: TraditionalToLiveLinq).
