AutoSizeColumns
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatically size sheet columns to fit their contents.

The sample loops through all cells measuring their contents, then sets
the column widths based on the widest entry.

This sample takes into account the cell contents, format and font. It
does not account for content wrapping or merging.
