#### Shows how you can build an OLAP application with a custom UI.
____
This sample builds a custom OLAP application with a ribbon-like
toolbar containing predefined views and filters. The OLAP controls
are displayed in docking tabs so the user can customize their
workspace. The C1OlapPanel control can be hidden or made sliding
so the user can focus on the grid and chart.
