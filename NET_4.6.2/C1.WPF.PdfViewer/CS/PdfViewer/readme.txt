PdfViewer
---------------------------
Shows the C1PdfViewer control.

The sample starts with a pre-loaded PDF about the ComponentOne XapOptimizer product. 
The sample shows how easy is to load a PDF into the control, and interact with the 
all its functionality provided in the toolbar. Besides, we added a "Load" button 
so you can test your own PDF files. As the control is not intended to loade every 
kind of PDF files out there, the Load button is not offered in the default toolbar, 
and we recommend to test the PDFs you will be working on before shipping your app.
