# ComponentOne WPF Edition Samples 

Deliver beautiful desktop applications fast with advanced datagrids, charts, and more for WPF.

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne WPF Edition](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/wpf-ui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the WPF control features. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org or developer.mescius/componentone.

## Building a Sample 

.NET Framework samples require Visual Studio 2012 and above. .NET Core samples will require Visual Studio 2017 and above. You can also build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). 

Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```

This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
