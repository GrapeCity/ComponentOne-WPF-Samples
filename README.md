.NET Core samples will require VS2017 and above. You can also build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). 

Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run
