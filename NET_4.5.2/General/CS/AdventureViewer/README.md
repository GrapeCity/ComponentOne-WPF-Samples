This demo uses DataTemplates following MVVM practices to show several different data views for the same data.

Grid view uses the C1DataGrid control and shows complex row details.

Detail view uses the C1PropertyGrid control and shows record navigation.

Tile view uses the C1Tileview control and shows detailed information when a tile is expanded.

Carousel view uses the C1CarouselPanel control and shows data in a more interactive way.

The demo uses a public Web service on demos.componentone.com to access data.
