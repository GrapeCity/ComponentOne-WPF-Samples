* FlexReport Viewer:

generated with FlexReport. It is possible to integrate the pane with your
tools to change the document zoom and layout options and to print the document
displayed in the C1FlexViewer control.


* Ssrs Viewer:

This sample shows how the C1SSRSDocumentSource component can be used with
C1FlexViewer to preview and print reports available on a SSRS server, and
to export reports to various formats.


* Export:

or pick a report from the list of predefined reports, and generates the report.
The report then can be exported to any of the supported external formats.
