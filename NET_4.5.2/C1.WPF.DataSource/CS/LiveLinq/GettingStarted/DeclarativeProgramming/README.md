#### LiveLinq live views make application development easier.
____
Live views can be used to combine data from multiple tables, group and
aggregate this data according to business rules, and make it available
to the application at all times. The views are always synchronized with
the data, so there is no need to call methods to update the views when
you need the data. This greatly simplifies application logic and
improves efficiency.

This sample shows how an entire application with non-trivial logic can
be built based on data binding, without code except for a declarative
live view definition.

The application shows orders and also sales totals (by category and by
product, sorted by amount). When you change orders (for example, increase
ordered quantity of a product), and it affects sales totals, you can see
that they are correctly updated automatically without any refreshes in code.
For details, see the "Getting Started" section of LiveLinq documentation.
