#### Bind your controls to LINQ queries, that is, to LiveLinq live views.
____
Standard LINQ queries are static, their results do not change automatically
when underlying data change. 

LiveLinq query result is a live view, which means it is kept constantly
up-to-date without re-populating it every time its base data changes.
This makes LiveLinq extremely useful in common data-binding scenarios where
objects are edited and may be filtered in or out of views, have their
associated subtotals updated, and so on.
