LiveLinqToDataSet
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Improving performance of LINQ to DataSet with LiveLinq indexing.

This sample shows how to use LiveLinq to query data residing in an
ADO.NET DataSet, how to create indexes over that data that make querying
faster than regular LINQ to DataSet queries. Both strongly typed and
untyped datasets are demonstrated in the sample.
