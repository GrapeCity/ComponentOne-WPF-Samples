#### Demonstrates how to achieve an Excel look and feel using a C1FlexGrid.
____
The sample uses the following helper classes:


* ColorScheme: Implements brushes similar to those used by the Excel 2007
  color schemes (Blue, Silver, and Black) and a method to apply the brushes
  to the appropriate C1FlexGrid properties.
  

* ExcelCellFactory: Cell factory class that creates row and column headers
  labeled like the ones in Excel (column headers are labeled A, B, C, ...
  and row headers are labeled 1, 2, 3,...). Also implements a top-left cell
  that can be clicked to select all rows and columns.
  
The sample shows how the grid supports the Excel look in bound and in unbound
modes.  
  
It also shows an Excel-like Marquee and cell editing, which are supported 
directly by the C1FlexGrid and do not require any additional code.
