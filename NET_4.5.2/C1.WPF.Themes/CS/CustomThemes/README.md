#### This sample shows how to create custom themes.
____
Custom themes are defined in MyCustomTheme project.


Basic: MyCustomTheme

* -------------------
Shows how to create a new theme from scratch for both the C1 controls.

The custom theme only defines a few general resources for the C1 controls,
special style for ComponentOne's ComboBox. As you will see, the rest
of the control remain unchanged (with the last applied theme).


Extending: MyCustomExpressionDark

* --------------------------------
Shows how to extend a C1Theme (in this case, C1ThemeExpressionDark) overriding
some specific styles or resources for any type of control.

In this sample we override a few general resources for all the C1 controls.
