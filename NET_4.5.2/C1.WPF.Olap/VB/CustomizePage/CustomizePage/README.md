#### Shows how you can customize the C1OlapPage control.
____
The sample creates a default view that is persisted across sessions
in isolated storage. It also adds a new menu to the C1OlapPage that 
contains a list of predefined views.

The IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings class allows you
to save and load application settings very easily.

The predefined views defined in this application show how you
can use the C1OlapField.Format property to group date values and
analyze sales by year, month, and weekday.
