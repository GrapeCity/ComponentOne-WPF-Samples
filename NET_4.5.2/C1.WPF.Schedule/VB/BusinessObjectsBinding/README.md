____
In this sample Window1.Appointments property is an instance of the AppointmentBOList class.
This property holds the list of AppointmentBusinessObject objects. 
The C1Scheduler's AppointmentStorage object uses this list as a data source. 
All changes to AppointmentBOList get reflected in the C1Scheduler control and vice versa.
Use toolbar buttons for creating new custom business objects or clear the list.
Use C1Calendar control for navigating through the C1Scheduler control.
