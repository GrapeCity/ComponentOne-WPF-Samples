AutoSizeTable
----------------------------------------
Shows how to set up a table with automatic column widths

The sample shows how to adjust a RenderTable's properties so that its
columns' widths are resized automatically to accommodate the table's
content. The sample draws two tables, one very simple, the other a bit
more interesting - data bound, with one column containing long texts
that are wrapped within cells.
